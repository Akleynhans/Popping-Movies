# Project1: Popping Movies!
- Popping Movies was created so that any movie enthusiast could search up their favorite movie and have easy access to see where it is streaming and view their favorite actors. This webpage has a simple design making it user friendly and quick to use. 
- There are some websites that have these individual features and we wanted to create a website that would have all of the features ready to use. Popping Movies allows users to search up their chosen movie and from there they are able to view where the movie is available to watch. They can also see the actors that played in the movie they searched up. Our website additonally allows users to save their most recent search. This is helpful if they need to remember where they left off from or if they recently saw a movie and liked it and wanted to reference it later.  
- We chose the DataBase API and the Streaming Availability for a few reasons. With the website being created to search up movies, we needed to have a reliable way to get access to the hundreds of movies that exist. We also wanted the website to show the actors who play in the movie for easy reference to the movie that was looked up. The DataBase API was trustworthy and had plenty of movies to choose from as well as the actors that played a role in the movie. The Streaming Availability API ensured that the user could see where the movie can be watched and it ahd multiple websites/applications for where to find the movie. This was extremely helpful because the user may only have one or a few streaming apps and this API would make sure that if a movie could be played somewhere that it would be listed when the movie is searched up. 
## Takeaways
- This was an incredibly fun project for many different reasons. We were able to choose the CSS framework we wanted to work with and we were able to utilize everything we had learned in class thus far. This included the HTML page which within that had all of our classes and IDs we created to connect to the CSS and JavaScript to make the website run smoothly and look well designed. 
- Our original wireframe was simple and we chose to go with a simple design for not only the beginning code but also for the user. This website is intended to have useful information based on the movies searched up, therefore the results and search container are one of the most important and largest areas on the screen. To add style we added a few pictures at the top of the website and a brief description so that users know how to use the website correctly and know what to expect when they search up a movie.
- We solidified our knowledge on CSS by using the GRID layout and ensuring all the classes and IDs were used correctly. This part was fun to make with the freedom of design (colors, font choices, etc.). We chose the grid design because it has a simple layout and we wanted the website to have the user focus on the search and the search results. 
- JavaScript was one of the most important parts we worked on because we needed to make sure that the user could type in the name of a movie and that the APIs we chose worked and functioned correctly. We had to make sure we had the event listeners correctly made and that the APIs were used correctly in the JavaScript file. 
- A nice addition to this website was the recently searched up feature that keeps the last movie that was searched up in the local storage array that way users could look back at the previous movies they searched up.
- This was a great first project because it used our knowledge of CSS, HTML, and JavaScript. We worked to make sure all of them were connected and were writeen in the best way for the website. This was also a great start at working together as the previous challenges were individual. It was helpful to hear feedback within the team on what we needed to do and go over pseudo coding together.
